<span class="headline">Stoel Rives Energy Law Alert:  Energy Financing Opportunities in the 2008 Farm Bill </span>                <p>           <br />6/1/2009        </p>                <p>Lately, a lot of attention has been focused on energy financing opportunities in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (the Stimulus Bill) (see our recent publication <a href="http://www.stoel.com/lawofseries.aspx"><em><u>Show Me the Money: The Law of the Stimulus</u></em></a>). However, there are still exciting opportunities for financing renewable energy systems contained in other existing sources. One such act with enormous potential is the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 (the "2008 Farm Bill"). The 2008 Farm Bill has numerous renewable energy funding opportunities. For example, on May 26, 2009, the U.S. Department of Agriculture ("USDA") published a Notice of Solicitation of Applications under the <a href="http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2009/pdf/E9-12178.pdf"><u>Rural Energy for America Program</u></a>. This notice comes just a few weeks after President Obama <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/President-Obama-Announces-Steps-to-Support-Sustainable-Energy-Options/"><u>directed</u></a> the USDA to implement financing opportunities from the 2008 Farm Bill.  </p><p><a href="http://www.stoel.com/showalert.aspx?Show=5465">Read full story here.</a></p>
