<p>Alternative Energy -  Demand for energy remains high and promises to increase.  To meet that demand for power ’AhaMana will seek out opportunities for alternative energy on  the Hawaiian Islands, including wind and solar  technology, underwater transmission cable, monitoring, grid tech, and improved distribution.</p> <p>’AhaMana is determined to provide existing island electric providers and their  ratepayers with sustainable and consistent rates.  We are committed as a builder and potential  independent power producer to supply local communities with sustainable, local sources of clean power.  We are committed to keeping these dollars local to improve jobs, education,  and economic prosperity.</p> <p><strong>AhaMana Alternative Energy Intitiatives:</strong></p> <ul>   <li>Pursuing and facilitating a fast ramp-up for existing  “grandfathered projects.”</li>   <li>Seeking development of “Requests for proposals for  Renewable Energy Projects (RE RFP)”</li>   <li>Generate energy at competitive rates for ratepayers.</li> </ul> <p>Wind  power on the islands of Hawaii is a viable source of renewable energy.  The potential for wind farms is often  mentioned to be in excess of 1,000 megawatts, or enough to light up 800,000  homes.  ’AhaMana is committed to  seeking out and developing alternative energy opportunities that will reduce  dependence on oil and create energy independence.  Sustainability, that’s  “power for the people.”</p>
