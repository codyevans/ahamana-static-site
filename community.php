<strong>Power for the People <br /> </strong><br />’AhaMana is dedicated to the development of renewable energy resources that will empower communities to increase quality of life.  <br /> <br /> <br /><strong>Kai Kalama Foundation <br /></strong> <br /><em>“We come from generations before.  To preserve generations yet to come.  Out of the Darkness.  Into the Light.  Life as it was meant to be.” </em>-Kai Kalama  <br /> <br />In honor of the man who brought ’AhaMana together, a portion of proceeds will be dedicated to the Kai Kalama Foundation for reinvestment into local communities and to pass along the Hawaiian tradition to generations of children to come.  <br /> <br />Kai Kalama Foundation founding principles: <br /><blockquote> <br />• The Kai Kalama Foundation is a Native Hawaiian Organization incorporated in Hawai’i, to operate and promote economic projects throughout the global community with the guidance of our ancestors. <br /> <br />• Our Vision:  the Kai Kalama Foundation will create a continually expanding network of Native Hawaiian business entities and service programs whose individual goals and purposes are aligned to strengthen and improve the Hawaiian community for generations to come. <br /> <br />• Our Mission:  We will adapt the ancient ahupua’a system to modern business practices, implement a participatory management system which depends on a paradigm shift towards responsibility and civic duty, provide monetary and managerial support and provide training and education through our non-profit partners. <br /> <br />• Purpose:  We will be a contemporary model for combining traditional Hawaiian culture and values with modern-day business practices while developing independence and sustainability. <br /></blockquote> <br /> <br /><strong><br />Local Stewardship </strong><br /> <br />'AhaMana is dedicated to fostering reciprocal stewardship throughout the communities we touch. The single largest impact we can make is to keep dollars local and re-energize local economies through: <br /> <br /><blockquote>• Decreasing dependence on foreign oil and moving towards domestic renewable energy <br />• Stabilizing consumer energy prices to lower cost of living <br />• Creating “Green Collar” sustainable jobs <br />• Utilizing local community resources  <br />• Creating and supporting local education programs </blockquote><blockquote> </blockquote><blockquote> </blockquote>
