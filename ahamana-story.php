<p><strong>The Passionate Intuition behind ’AhaMana’s commitment to the Kai Kalama Foundation:</strong></p><p><br /><img src="images/sima_kai.jpg" border="0" alt="Sima, Kai, Lance Daniels, and Jimmy Fujita" /><br /><em>(Pictured from left: Sima Muroff, Kai Kalama, Lance Daniels, Jimmy Fujita) </em></p><p> </p><p>By: Sima Muroff, CEO Blackhawk on the River and proud team member of ’AhaMana<br /><br />I met Kai Kalama through Jimmy Fujita on a trip to Kauai in August of 2004. During our visit we stopped in at Kimo’s to rent a bicycle for the day and Mr. Fujita and I began discussing our business philosophies, families and the wonderful Hawaiian culture. By the end of our conversation, we had set up a lunch where I was to be introduced to Kai Kalama. Since that lunch, where Kai shared the Hawaiian Stewardship vision he called Mai Ka Po, a concept that he had spent his life fine tuning and living, events moved forward rapidly. <br /><br />Back home in Idaho, I continued to share Kai’s vision with everyone in my acquaintance. Over the next few years, with many visits back and forth between us, we began to formulate a plan to make Kai'a Hawaiian Stewardship vision a reality. Shortly thereafter and just prior to his passing in New York, my family joined Kai and his extensive network of associates in Oahu where we were able to reach a global audience and continue to build and strengthen the relationships Kai introduced us to.</p><p> </p><p><a href="images/photos/img_6101.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="images/photos/img_6101.jpg" border="0" alt="Inspiration dinner, Hawaii 2007.

At Kai’s celebration of life at Kailua Bay in 2007, I was humbled to see the enormous impact Kai’s life and vision had on so many of his friends and family. The time I spent with Kai Kalama introduced me to a world ideal that I had believed only existed in the back recesses of my mind. He unlocked wisdom and insights that still resonate in my daily intentions: walking with Mother Nature’s harmonious symphony, lessons of the “light keeper’s” Mana, signs, manifestations, and above all unlimited abundance of love. </p><p><br /><a href="images/photos/img_6117.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="images/photos/img_6117.jpg" border="0" alt="Sir Vincent and guest, George Burns, Crystal Luna, Rick Luna, Katy Muroff, Lance Daniels, Sima Muroff, Chris Fairburn, Butch Anderson." width="327" height="245" /></a> </p><em>(Sir Vincent and guest, George Burns, Crystal Luna, Rick Luna, Katy Muroff, Lance Daniels, Sima Muroff,  Butch Anderson.)</em> 
<p> </p>
<p>In April 2009, Kai’s sister, Puna, came to visit me in Idaho. During  their stay, the fire behind Kai's vision was rekindled and ’AhaMana was born.</p>
<p> </p><p>It is difficult to put into words what ’AhaMana means to me and all those involved. I would like to borrow an excerpt from a book authored by Lyle Nelson, four-time Olympian and captain of a 1988 US Olympic Team, who met Kai on one of his last visits to Idaho. The idea of “passionate intuition” is the driving force behind the vision of Kai Kalama and the mission behind ’AhaMana…</p><blockquote><p>Thomas Morris, the philosopher who teaches the Meaning of life at University of Notre Dame, has given a definition of purpose that illuminates the “passionate intuition.”<br /><br />“We are here to attempt to give more to this life than we take from it, a task that, if undertaken properly, is impossible. The more we give the more we get. But that is the Point.<br /><br />Too many of us have been taught to suppress our natural passion. No Greater loss is there than to lose our passion for daily life.<br /><br />Passion isn’t an emotion gone out of control: it is the fierce desire that directs our energy to uncommon achievements. As such, passion, taken to its heights, is like a holy fire that consumes and releases the exalted spirit in the flame of high endeavor.”</p></blockquote><p><br /><a href="images/photos/img_6104.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="images/photos/img_6104.jpg" border="0" alt="Kai’s Celebration of Life, Kialua Bay, 2007." width="327" height="245" /></a></p><em>(Kai’s Celebration of Life, Kialua Bay, 2007)</em> <p> <br /><br />I am proud to say that the commitment I made to Kai Kalama when we spoke during his final hours has been realized. I want to thank him for sparking my own passionate intuition and illuminating the path for ’AhaMana. </p>
