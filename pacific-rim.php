<p>Traditionally Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders have depended on foreign oil for the bulk of their energy needs. Consequently money has flowed out of he local community and into the hands of large corporations with little vested interest in the area. <br />   <br />   Currently in Hawaii ninety-percent (90%) of all energy is imported to the island.  The island is 3000 miles away from the nearest continent.  The need for local and sustainable power is great.<br />   <br />   ’AhaMana is dedicated to providing sources of renewable alternative energy to bring Power for the People.<br />   <br />   ’AhaMana -  an innovative company using innovative technology.</p> <ul>   <li><strong>Forensic Spatial Analysis:</strong> To determine the ideal locations for wind and solar projects throughout the Islands, ’AhaMana utilizes forensic spatial analysis of past and present models to generate 40-year wind and solar patterns. This methodology is superior to point-in-time analysis for evaluating where wind and solar projects can be most effective over the long-term.  Through our partnerships, ’AhaMana is able to utilize mapping technology from the global leader in the field.</li><br />   <li><strong>Superior technology:</strong> ’AhaMana is an active participant in the advancement of both solar and wind energy generation technology. Innovative vertical and horizontal wind turbines, solar towers, and solar parabolic dishes are just a few examples of the technology ’AhaMana is exploring.</li></ul><blockquote><blockquote>Emerging ’AhaMana Technologies: <br /></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 40px; border-width: initial; border-color: initial; border-style: none; padding: 0px"><blockquote style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 40px; border-width: initial; border-color: initial; border-style: none; padding: 0px"><blockquote style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 40px; border-width: initial; border-color: initial; border-style: none; padding: 0px">We currently have a patent pending on a new more efficient wind turbine featuring neodymium magnets that cut down on friction and increase the life of the turbine. <br /></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 40px; border-width: initial; border-color: initial; border-style: none; padding: 0px"><blockquote style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 40px; border-width: initial; border-color: initial; border-style: none; padding: 0px"><blockquote style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 40px; border-width: initial; border-color: initial; border-style: none; padding: 0px"> </blockquote><blockquote style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 40px; border-width: initial; border-color: initial; border-style: none; padding: 0px">We are developing a solar panel system that would allow for 1 MW of energy to be generated using only 5 acre parcels.

By keeping our scope broad, ’AhaMana will be able to utilize natural resources more efficiently to create a larger impact on the local communities we serve. </li><br />   <li><strong>Smart Grid System:</strong> As we enter a new age of greener energy production our energy transportation and delivery systems must also evolve. ’AhaMana strives to be on the cutting edge of efficiency and low impact transmission. Our smart grids utilize sensors, meters, digital controls and analytic tools. This allows us to monitor the energy from the ocean breeze to the light switch in your home. Doing so gives us greater ability than ever before to ensure we are using Mother Nature’s power to her greatest potential; maximizing unrealized energy and minimizing waste is what our Smart Grid System is all about. With a power grid created by some of the top minds from around the world, our team makes stewardship a top priority. We are committed to providing green power and energy independence now while preserving the beauty of the land for future generations.   </li> </ul>
