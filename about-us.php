<blockquote>   <p class="style1">“Ahupua’a” - A holistic relationship, a kinship with all the living creatures that occupy the place where you live that results in a natural pono (balance).</p> </blockquote> <p>’AhaMana was founded by the friends and family of the late Kai Kalama and was inspired by his passion to integrate ahupua’a back into the lives of Hawaiians. ’AhaMana’s members are dedicated to empowering the people of Hawaii through renewable resource technology that will start to rebuild the sustainable natural landscape once honored through the ahupua’a system.</p> <p>’<strong>AhaMana: A coming together of great minds<br /> </strong> A challenge lies ahead. Hawaii’s dependence on foreign oil is significant, but there has never been a better opportunity to leverage the forward thinking momentum of alternative energy.</p> <p>Achieving this goal won’t be easy. Energy independence on the Hawaiian and Pacific Islands will require cooperation, leadership, and a coming together of great minds like those dedicated to the ’AhaMana vision.</p> <p>Our team offers a breadth of experience from vertical and horizontal developers, leaders in energy law, manufacturers of next generation renewable energy technology and skilled project managers. The AhaMana group is committed to transforming the energy economy from a one-way, sales-based oil dependent relationship, to a greener, low cost energy independent economy.</p>
